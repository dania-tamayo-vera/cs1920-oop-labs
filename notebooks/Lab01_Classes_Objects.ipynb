    "1. The constructor takes at least: owner and an optional starting balance (default 0).\n",

    "3. The method deposit(amount) increases the balance.\n",
    "4. The method withdraw(amount) decreases the balance.\n",
    "5. You should decide how to handle invalid amounts or overdraft. You can raise errors or print messages, but be consistent.\n",
