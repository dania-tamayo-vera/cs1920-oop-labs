# CS1920 Labs 
Colab based Python OOP labs for UPEI CS 1920, with design, pseudocode, implementation, and debugging exercises.

## How to use these notebooks in Colab

You do not need to clone this repository to work on the labs. The simplest workflow is:

1. Open the lab in Colab

   a. Go to  
      https://colab.research.google.com

   b. In the dialog that appears, click the "GitHub" tab.

   c. Paste this repository URL in the search box:  
      https://github.com/dania-tamayo-vera/cs1920-oop-labs

   d. Press Enter. Colab will list available notebooks.

   e. Click the notebook for the lab you want, for example:  
      `notebooks/Lab01_Classes_Objects.ipynb`.

2. Save your own copy

   Once the notebook opens in Colab:

   a. Use the menu: File → Save a copy in Drive  
   b. This creates your personal copy. Work only in that copy.

3. Run the setup cell

   At the top of the notebook you will see a setup cell. It asks for your name and installs the helper library.

   a. Fill in the student name fields.  
   b. Click the play button on the left of the cell to run it.  
   c. Wait until you see a message that the setup is complete.

4. Work on the lab

   a. Follow the instructions in the notebook from top to bottom.  
   b. Find the cell labeled "Student code" and write or edit the Python code there, for example the `BankAccount` class.  
   c. Do not rename the class or delete any cells that were already provided.

5. Run the self checks

   Near the bottom of the notebook there is a cell labeled "Self checks".

   a. Run your student code cell first.  
   b. Then run the self check cell.  
   c. Look at the output. Green checks indicate that a test passed, red crosses indicate something to fix.  
   d. If a test fails, go back to your code cell, correct it, and run the self check again.

6. Saving your work

   Colab automatically saves your work to your Google Drive copy of the notebook. You can also download a copy at any time using:

   File → Download → Download .ipynb
